# Levenshtein Distance Algorithm Implementation in SWI Prolog
The Levenshtein Distance Algorithm, also known as Edit Distance, is a measure of the similarity between two strings by calculating the minimum number of single-character edits required to transform one string into the other. These edits can be insertions, deletions, or substitutions.

Named after the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who introduced it in 1965, the algorithm is widely used in various applications, including spell checking, DNA sequence analysis, and natural language processing.

The algorithm is based on dynamic programming and involves constructing a matrix where each cell represents the minimum edit distance between substrings of the two input strings. The goal is to fill the matrix efficiently to find the minimum edit distance from the top-left corner (representing an empty string) to the bottom-right corner (representing the entire input strings).

The dynamic programming approach allows the algorithm to efficiently handle various cases and avoid redundant computations, resulting in a time complexity of O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the two input strings.

The Levenshtein Distance is a versatile metric that can be used not only for spelling correction but also for tasks such as approximate string matching, plagiarism detection, and DNA sequence alignment. It provides a quantitative measure of similarity that is valuable in a wide range of computational applications.
